Product Requirements Document (PRD) Verus Marketplace Tauri App

Project Overview

Product Name: VerusIDX
Platform: Desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Technology Stack: Tauri, Svelte, TypeScript, Rust
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application that allows users to interact with the Verus marketplace, connecting to their local Verus nodes for both testnet and mainnet (& any pbaas chains on mainnet).

Target Audience

- Verus cryptocurrency users
- Blockchain enthusiasts
- Marketplace participants

Key Features

4.1 User Configuration
- RPC username and password input
- Network selection (verus testnet/mainnet & pbaas chains)
- Port number configuration
- Optional node address input

4.2 Marketplace Functionality
- Identity: registernamecommitment & registeridentity, updateidentity, getidentity
- Currency: definecurrency & sendrawtransaction, getcurrency, listcurrencies
- Offers: getoffers, makeoffer, takeoffer, closeoffers, listopenoffers

4.3 Node Interaction
- Secure connection to local Verus node
- Real-time data synchronization
- Transaction broadcasting

4.4 User Interface
- Modern, intuitive design
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Responsive layout

Technical Requirements

5.1 Tauri Framework
- Package the app for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Handle native OS interactions
- Utilize Rust for performance-critical operations

5.2 Svelte + TypeScript Frontend
- Develop reactive UI components
- Implement state management (e.g., Svelte stores)
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript

5.3 Rust Backend
- Implement secure RPC communication with Verus node
- Handle data processing and caching
- Integrate with Tauri's IPC for frontend communication

5.4 Data Storage
- Secure local storage for user preferences using Tauri's storage API
- Temporary caching of marketplace data

5.5 Security
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., RPC credentials) using Tauri's secure storage
- Implement secure communication protocols
- Regular security audits
- Utilize Tauri's security features like CSP and allowlist

User Flow

6.1 First-time Setup
- App installation
- Node configuration
- User onboarding

6.2 Regular Usage
- Login/authentication
- Browse marketplace
- Perform transactions
- Manage listings

Performance Requirements

- Fast startup time (< 2 seconds, leveraging Tauri's efficiency)
- Responsive UI (interactions < 50ms, utilizing Svelte's reactivity)
- Efficient data synchronization with local node

Testing Requirements

- Unit testing for all Svelte components and Rust functions
- Integration testing for node communication
- User acceptance testing on all supported platforms
- End-to-end testing using tools compatible with Tauri

Deployment and Updates

- Self-contained executable for each platform
- Auto-update mechanism using Tauri's built-in updater
- Version tracking and changelog

Future Considerations

- Potential transition to web-based application (easier with Tauri's web-based architecture)
- Integration with mobile platforms
- Enhanced features based on user feedback
- Potential for creating a browser extension version

Success Metrics

- Number of active users
- Transaction volume through the marketplace
- User retention rate
- App stability (crash reports)
- Performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
